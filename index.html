                            <h1>The <em>Project</em> Bike</h1>
                            <p>I gave a whole new life to an old motorcycle that deserves to be taken care of and probably saved it from ending up in a junkyard. <br>
							How? <em>by turning it into a Cafe Racer!</em></p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text-content">
                            <p>While working as an IE intern at Dochaki Designs, I used to conceptualize and design custom motorbikes to meet the client’s needs. That's when I discovered an old motorcycle, most likely from the 2000s or earlier. Around this time, Japanese bikes were popularly referred to as UJMs or Universal Japanese Motorcycles. They have a strong foundation, making them an excellent choice for converting a classic motorbike into a cafe racer.</p>
                        </div>
						<div class="text-content">
						<p>In my project, I had a limited budget and a workshop where I interned. To execute this project, I used my mastery in design and fabrication that I learned during my internship. Working on the bike for about 2-3 hours per day (aside from office hours) took about three months. So approximately 250 hours were spent on this time-consuming yet rewarding process. The bike I based my project on is a <em>TVS Victor</em> that had 128,000 kilometers.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="section-heading">
						<p><em>On my project, here is what I did:</em></p>
						</div>
						<div class="section-heading">
						<p>1. Reduced Weight (Added Lightness)</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text-content">
						<p>Shedding weight from this motorcycle was essential to breaking the revered "ton" (100 mph) barrier back in the 1950s. Achieving featherweight status is still indispensable for speed today, plus it will improve my motorcycle's stopping power, steering response, and fuel economy. I removed the battery and starter motor for a kick-only setup, swapped steel OEM parts with aluminum alternatives, and discarded the airbox in favor of pod filters. I saved my budget by switching the lead-acid battery for a lithium-ion battery and replacing the stock muffler with an aftermarket one. While chasing that classic cafe silhouette, I also shed some pounds—a clip-on and a low-profile custom seat are far lighter than touring bars and that factory-made slab of foam.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="section-heading">
						<p>2. Increased Power</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text-content">
						<p>Eking more power out of a bike’s engine is another great way to tone it up. Sure, most bikes these days can achieve 100 mph with relative ease, but that doesn’t mean we should ignore this potent ingredient. I began with the air intake, where my bike gulps fuel and air and converts them into pure thrills at the twist of the throttle. Stock systems are usually constrained due to stringent emissions regulations, leaving gobs of unused power on the workbench. Fortunately, a low-cost, free-flowing air filter helped to transform my bike's intake from haggard to hoover. With exhaust gases flowing more efficiently through an aftermarket pipe, I have unleashed even more power. You’ll likely see the most gains (and weight reduction) from a full custom system, but even slip-on mufflers will give a little kick. With my modifications, this bike is no longer guzzling more gas or running rough. In the end, I saved some time by tuning the carbs using a jet kit and installing a completely new set of performance carbs.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="section-heading">
						<p>3. Cafe Racer Proportions</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text-content">
						<p>No one has ever looked at a stock Honda CB and thought, "Wow, what a lean, mean machine!" So I have made some significant visual changes to achieve that iconic cafe-racer character. First, the visual weight of the motorcycle (where it draws your eye) consists of the fuel tank and engine block. To set this off from the rest of the frame, I have swapped the bulky stock airboxes for sleek pod filters, slimmed down the rear fender, and traded the OEM seat for a custom low-profile unit. Then I draw two vertical lines extending from each axle—nothing should protrude beyond these lines. Adding a cowl that terminates over the axle gave this bike continuity and served as an extension of the fuel tank. I have designed the fuel tank in Solidworks; through multiple iterations, it now transitions into the cowl on a single-radius curve as if they were previously one unit. Another visual cue, called the bone line, marks the widest point of my bodywork. On a cafe bike, it’s where the headlight, fuel tank, and seat cowl align. I have dropped the headlight in line with the tank to make the front end look poised for speed.</p>
						<div>
						<div class="section-heading">
						<p>4. Paint Work</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text-content">
						<p>Paint application is a major chunk of work that must be done correctly because it is the first thing people notice when they look at your finished project. If the paint looks bad, they will assume the rest of the bike is poor. For me, it had to be a shiny, polished bike. Any shortcuts will result in a less-than-ideal paint job.</p>
                        </div>
						<div class="text-content">
						<p>"surface prep + primer + wet sanding + base coat + wet sanding + clear coat + wet sanding + polishing = everything"</p>
						</div>
						<div class="section-heading">
						<p>5. Simplified Electronics</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text-content">
						<p>The final frontier for stripping down this bike is removing any unnecessary or outdated wiring and electronics. Most 1980s and 1990s bikes have a lot of bulk that we can remove during the cafe racer build. Wiring is frequently one of the most dreaded tasks among inexperienced builders. But by trimming the electronic fat, I have reduced room for error, saved weight, and streamlined the bike’s appearance. It also helps that there is a vast aftermarket of amazing modern electrical components available today. By installing an electronic ignition module, I was able to increase the efficiency of my cafe racer. It charges the coil with an optical sensor instead of the mechanical contact breaker "points" method, allowing for a brighter spark and smoother operation at any speed. Aside from improved starting and enhanced power, the electronic module's absence of moving parts allows me to spend more time with my family rather than setting and resetting points till the wee hours of the morning every Saturday night.</p>

                                <p>#1 I spend my time figuring out how to make machinery look as good as it can. Designing a cafe racer is as much about art as science, and each bike is unique in its own way. For years, I've been influenced by motorcycle design. It's based on the same observations that I've sketched out here.</p>

                                <p>#2 I used SOLIDWORKS 3D to make my design concept a reality, allowing me to simulate the design through various scenarios and make necessary adjustments during the design development process. This increased my design efficiency because I won't have to revisit the concept later.</p>

                                <p>#3 Sorting, for me, implies separating reusable pieces from those that will be discarded; this can happen during the teardown. Before removing a part, I snap a picture of it in its original spot and another after it has been removed. After scraping, I cleaned and repainted the pieces to remove years of accumulated grime, oil, and grease.</p>

                                <p>#4 I prefer to do this when the frame is naked and able to be positioned in any orientation. This avoids welding upside down under the frame, which results in improved weld quality and easier cleanup if required. To decide where to cut the frame, I look at anything going beyond the wheel centerlines. Always "measure twice and cut once"!</p>

                                <p>#5 Before we undertake any adjustments, the tank must be thoroughly cleaned since even a small amount of fuel vapor can be ignited by a spark, leading to a possibly deadly explosion. I redesigned the gas tank from a 1993 Suzuki Samurai to build the customized fuel tank.</p>

                                <p>#6 Before applying primer, I used a surface degreaser to ensure that the surface was properly clean. To apply the paint, I used the compressed air canisters to reduce all the cleanup drudgery. This avoids trying to adjust the spray gun for the right pressure and paint thickness. To protect the paint work, I applied a clear coat at the end.</p>

                                <p>#7 This is one of my favorite steps—the step where creativity is the key. To match the fuel tank, I mounted a cafe racer seat that was just partially upholstered. On the rear of the seat, an LED brake light strip, a black metal side panel with perforations, and turn signals were affixed. In addition, I've installed bar-end mirrors, a circular headlight, fork boots, clip-on bars, and a bespoke saddle bag.</p>

                                <p>#8 A cafe racer is completely defined by a flat line from front to rear, parallel to the ground, or with a slightly forward rake. This line gives a cafe racer a no-nonsense look that speaks of strength and speed. This line should remain uninterrupted unless it is structurally necessary to break it up. The straight line should sit upon two nearly even-sized wheels.</p>

                                <p>#9 I took an old bike that was dusty, rusted, and corroded, renewed everything, and transformed it into a brand-new bike that never fails to amaze people on the streets. I hope this inspires some of you to take the leap and start this café project you've been dreaming about.</p>
