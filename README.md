**Greetings and welcome to my site!** 

Designing a cafe racer is as much about art as science, and each bike is unique in its own way.

**Overview:**

I gave a whole new life to an old motorcycle that deserves to be taken care of and probably saved it from ending up in a junkyard. <br>
                                           How? _by turning it into a Cafe Racer!_
