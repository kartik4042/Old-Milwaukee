**Greetings and welcome to my site!** 

Designing a cafe racer is as much about art as science, and each bike is unique in its own way.

**Overview:**

I gave a whole new life to an old motorcycle that deserves to be taken care of and probably saved it from ending up in a junkyard. <br>
                                           How? _by turning it into a Cafe Racer!_ <br> <br>
While working as an IE intern at Dochaki Designs, I used to conceptualize and design custom motorbikes to meet the client’s needs. That's when I discovered an old motorcycle, most likely from the 2000s or earlier. Around this time, Japanese bikes were popularly referred to as UJMs or Universal Japanese Motorcycles. They have a strong foundation, making them an excellent choice for converting a classic motorbike into a cafe racer. <br>

In my project, I had a limited budget and a workshop where I interned. To execute this project, I used my mastery in design and fabrication that I learned during my internship. Working on the bike for about 2-3 hours per day (aside from office hours) took about three months. So approximately 250 hours were spent on this time-consuming yet rewarding process. The bike I based my project on is a TVS Victor that had 128,000 kilometers.
